    "4. The complete question is printed.\n",
    "   \n",
    "The code can also print French and Japanese translations of the generated question.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It can also generate a random piece of Keanu Reeves trivia instead of a question.\n",

    "## The Concept  \n",
    "The program is based on my experience of our own breakfast hour icebreakers, which seem to fit into two categories:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Questions from which people must choose one out of two provided options.  \n",
    "  Example: \"Would you rather be able to talk to animals, or know how to play every musical instrument?\"\n",
    "- Open-ended questions that encourage people to discuss their opinions on a subject.  \n",
    "  Example: \"What's your favorite pizza topping?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For the former question type to be effective, the two options provided must be _both negative_ or _both positive,_ or else the question is not worth contemplating. After all, the following question is pretty easy to answer, isn't it?  \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Would you rather be stung by a murder hornet, or win a million dollars tax free?\"  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a picture of a murder hornet to illustrate how horrible they are, compared to a regular western honeybee.  \n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "![](https://www.bellinghamherald.com/latest-news/ab3it/picture242408291/alternates/FREE_1140/Asian%20hornet.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "Nor should options be neutral. Your audience must be moved emotionally or rationally enough to want to answer the question.  \n",
    "  \n",
    "To this end, the icebreaker program will generate three types of questions:  \n",
    "  \n",
    "- Negative \"would you rather\" questions  \n",
    "  Example: \"Would you rather be stranded on a desert island or stuck in an elevator?\"  \n",
    "- Positive \"would you rather\" questions  \n",
    "  Example: \"Would you rather win the Nobel Prize or the lottery?\"  \n",
    "- Open-ended questions  \n",
    "  \"Which actor would play you in a movie about your life?\"  \n",
    "  \n",
    "The type of question will be chosen at random, as will the options if it is a \"Would you rather\" type of question. All components of the questions are stored in [this breakfast hour dataset](data/breakfast_hour.csv).  \n",

    "## Limitations  \n",
    "\n",
    "While this icebreaker generator might be more convenient than generative AI or googling icebreakers, the results you get might be on par. That is, not every icebreaker this generates will be gold.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The French translations might be better than the Japanese. While I was able to write and proofread in French, using even common syntax and phrasing in my code comments that French software engineers commonly use, I used an online translator to get the Japanese translations and cannot guarantee the same level of acuity there.  \n",
